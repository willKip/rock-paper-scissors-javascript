# Rock-Paper-Scissors: Javascript Edition
A simple implementation of Rock-Paper-Scissors in Javascript.

The computer makes a hidden, randomized choice between rock, paper, and scissors, 
and the player enters input by pressing the corresponding button.

The results are displayed on the screen after every round, and when either the computer or the player
reaches 5 points, the winner is announced and scores are reset.

There is currently a very basic level of styling involved; this project aims to demonstrate Javascript capabilities.
