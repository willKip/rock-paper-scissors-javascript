# Rock-Paper-Scissors: Javascript Edition
A simple implementation of Rock-Paper-Scissors in Javascript.

Project includes a skeleton html file, which refers to rps.js, the main logic.

By default, it goes through 5 rounds of rock paper scissors, in which the computer makes 
a randomized choice, and the player enters input through a prompt() call.

Choice input must be a full word (e.g. Rock, paper, SCISSORS); any capitalization works.

Refer to the console to see the results.
